# 8. Next Steps & References

## Goal
Know where to go after the basics.

## Suggestions
- Explore ERC standards: start with ERC20 (fungible tokens) and ERC721 (NFTs). Implement minimal versions and test transfers/approvals.
- Add tooling: ESLint/Prettier, `hardhat-gas-reporter`, `solhint` for Solidity linting.
- Try forking mainnet: `npx hardhat node --fork <ALCHEMY_OR_INFURA_URL>` and interact with live contracts in a sandbox.
- Learn upgrades: experiment with OpenZeppelin Upgrades plugin (proxy patterns), and understand upgrade risks.
- Security mindset: read recent post-mortems; practice with capture-the-flag sites (e.g., Ethernaut).
